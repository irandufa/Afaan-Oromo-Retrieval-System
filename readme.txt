 Direction of using the System:
                                  
This project has two parts/modules: indexing and searching
 The indexing module used to create vocabulary files and posting files,
 
There are 10 afaan oromoo document collection within the folder named as 'AfaanOromodocumentcollection'
for each document, each word are listed and kept in folder named as 'documentwordlist' 
listing all word was helped as to generate stopword and stemming.

the file 'nwstem' is the suffix list of afaan oromoo documents
 the file 'OromoDoc_Collection' is the files that gives us the path of all document collection
 the file 'AfanOromostopwordlist2' is the stopwordlist of each document collection
 
To run the project first right click on indexing and open with IDLE (python interface) and then using 
cnrl+f5 (control plus f5) it is posible to check it wether the code is work or not. 
if it says 'faayilli index keessan isinii hojjeteera' it run successefully. 
however, the code might be error to run due to variety of python version and the syntax. this project uses python 2.7.2
if you try to check with other python version some commands like print, iteritems and raw_input may be not work. 
thus it is possible to change the code with python version

after running index code now it is possible to run searchin module in the same proceess. and the searching is now possible. 
 
have a fun time!
